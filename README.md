#  Knee_MRI_Segmentation_2.5D
<p align="justify">This GitHub repository includes all Python codes, annotation guideline, fully annotated imaging dataset, AI models, and a lightweight software applicationt to offer a clinically oriented and explainable deep learning framework, namely <strong>KneeXNet-2.5D</strong>, for accurate and efficient knee cartilage and meniscus segmentation in sagittal MRIs. Unlike traditional 3D segmentation methods, the proposed model employs a 2.5D architecture to capture the inter-slice spatial context, achieving high segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and optimal resource utilization. To enable open scientific research and ensure reproducibility, we have made this GitHub repository publicly and freely available for any research and educational purposes.
